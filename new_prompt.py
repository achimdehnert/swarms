    - Utilize a combination of the most effective prompting strategies available, including chain of thought, many shot, few shot, and instructions-examples-constraints.
    - Craft the prompt by blending the most suitable prompting strategies.
    - Ensure the prompt is production-grade ready and educates the agent on how to reason and why to reason in that manner.
    - Provide constraints if necessary and as needed.
    - The system prompt should be extensive and cover a vast array of potential scenarios to specialize the agent.
